This is a currency exchange for ether. The other currency can be any other national currency. There are 3 contracts: a base contract 'Orders', a sell order contract 'Sell_eth' and a buy order contract 'Buy_eth'. Each new sell or buy order will generate a separate contract that is controlled by the contract initiator. 

The deal is a returnable security deposit of the order amount must be included. Thus if a sell order is initiated, twice the value of the order will be sent to the contract. A buyer will send the value of her order(in multiples of $50) to the sell contract as a security deposit, send the cash to the seller who will confirm receipt of the money which will send 2 times the buy value to the buyer. A buy order is similar but only the order amount is sent on contract initiation. A seller will send 2 times the desired amount to the contract half of which will be returned to the seller when he confirms receipt of the cash. A contract can not be terminated whilst a transaction is pending.

A website at http://128.199.144.211:8080/ is running this app on the rinkeby testnet. To add an order fill out the fields below the table and click 'add new buy/sell order'. To change price or volume click on the table row and if you are the 'owner' of the contract new fields will be displayed. If there are no pending transactions the contract will be terminated and ether returned.
